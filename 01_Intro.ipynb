    "What does `learn` mean in this context, you may be asking? \n",
    "\n",
    "> The \"learn\" in machine learning means a program can **teach itself** how to make decisions by reading vast amounts of data and looking for patterns. Machine learning systems are **never told explicitly** how to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of learning from data is called `training`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about `ML` systems, people often use the term `pipeline`, which I define as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Each step in the `pipeline` holds an **important function** that is vital for the machine learning system to operate. It's aptly named \"pipeline\" because you can imagine data as water, flowing through a pipeline comprised of various pipes that, in this case, have different functions:\n",

    "- `Data points` (**X**) - the information you want the model to learn from\n",
    "- `Labels` (**y**) - the correct, labeled output attached to each instance of **X**.\n",

    "The data points and labels are represented as an (**X**, **y**) pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`absolute goal`** of a supervised ML system is to **train** it to predict the **correct labels**. We do this by showing it many instances of data in hopes that it will learn what we want it to learn. Each time the model makes a prediction, we **compare** it to the **correct label** to see if the model did well. This is what the `supervised` part refers to.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"><b>Note:</b> There are numerous ways to refer to <b>y</b> such as: <b>labels, targets, gold labels, classes, truths,</b> and possibly more.

    "\n",
    "In this example, our **true labels** are _circle_, _square_, and _triangle_. These are the labels we need our model to learn how to predict correctly. To accomplish this, imagine we have 10,000 instances of these (**shape**, **label**) pairs. You could imagine the training process being as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(ðŸŸ¥, square) -> Model predicts \"circle\" -> Check if \"circle\" == square -> Incorrect\n",
    "(ðŸŸ¥, square) -> Model predicts \"triangle\" -> Check if \"triangle\" == square -> Incorrect\n",

    "(ðŸ”´, circle) -> Model predicts \"circle\" -> Check if \"circle\" == circle -> Correct\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is followed for **every instance in our training data** and over time, as the model sees more examples, it will **gradually get better at predicting**. Thankfully, we don't need to do this manually, as machine learning APIs do this for us. But the intuition is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">You can think of this as being <em>similar</em> to how humans learn; the more we do things, the better we get at it. It's (roughly) the same concept, although humans require <em>significantly</em> less \"training data\" to learn things.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "If this all seems too abstract at the moment, don't fret! When we start constructing machine learning models and actually applying these concepts, it will be easier to visualize.\n",

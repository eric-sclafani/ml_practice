    "As humans, our insatiable desire to `learn`, make `inferences` about things, and `predict future events` requires **knowledge** about the world. This knowledge is where <span style=\"color:hotpink\">data</span> comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style=\"color:hotpink\">Data</span>** is the information that enables you to do all of those things mentioned above. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Say I want to learn what about the **gender wage gap** in the US. I could collect the following data from a large amount of people working at various companies: <span style=\"color:lightblue\">gender</span>, <span style=\"color:lightblue\">age</span>, <span style=\"color:lightblue\">salary</span>, <span style=\"color:lightblue\">years spent at the company</span>, <span style=\"color:lightblue\">education level</span>, and so on. I could then plot this data to `look for trends`. I could also try to `predict` someone's salary based off this data.\n",

    "Today, you'd be hard pressed to find a single company or business that does _not_ utilize data in the decision making process. "

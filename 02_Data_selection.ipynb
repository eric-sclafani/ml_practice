    "# **Whats the deal with data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As humans, our insatiable desire to `learn`, make `inferences` about things, and `predict future events` requires **knowledge** about the world. This knowledge is where data comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data** is the information that enables you to do all of those things mentioned above. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Say I want to learn what about the **gender wage gap** in the US. I could collect the following data from a large amount of people working at various companies:\n",
    "- gender\n",
    "- age\n",
    "- salary\n",
    "- years spent at the company\n",
    "- education level\n",
    "\n",
    "I could then plot this data to `look for trends`. I could also try to `predict` someone's salary based off this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections of data like this are called `datasets`. Today, you'd be hard pressed to find a single company or business that does _not_ utilize datasets in the decision making process. The role of data is becoming increasingly important as technology improves. "

    "## Features, attributes, variables, or ... columns?\n",
    "\n",
    "When data is recorded, the bits of information we're interested in go by different names depending on who you ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In `computer science`, they are called features or attributes. \n",
    "- In `statistics`, they are called variables\n",
    "- In `linear algebra`, they are the columns of an array/matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the information that lets us teach machines to automatically do what we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this point on, I use the term features, as this is used in `machine learning` (ML).\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of features:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Say I want to create a machine learning algorithm that `predicts Amazon's stock price` for the `following day`. I can use features such as **today's stock prices**, **yesterday's stock prices**, **two days ago**, **three days ago**, etc... I can go as far back as I want. \n",
    "\n",
    "> By using these features, my ML algorithm will (ideally) `learn how to predict the next day's stock price` for Amazon by looking for patterns in the previous days' stock prices (i.e., if the price has been **decreasing steadily** for the past couple of days, my model may predict a price lower than the previous day's.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flavors of features\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all features are equal. Features exhibit certain properties and are divided into two groups: `quantitative` and `qualitative` features. \n",
    "\n",
    "### *Quantitative*\n",
    "\n",
    "*`Quantitative features`* are ones recorded as numbers. This can be in the form of a ranking, a measurement, a count of occurences of things, and more. These types of features are also referred to as **numerical**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of `quantitative features` would be the following mini dataset containing measures from college students:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Weight (lbs) | Height (ft) | Age | GPA (1-4) | # of enrolled classes |\n",
    "|--------------|-------------|-----|-----------|-----------------------|\n",

    "| 208          | 6'4         | 24  | 3.3       | 4                     |\n",
    "| 123          | 5'5         | 21  | 3.7       | 4                     |\n",

    "\n",
    "### *Qualitative*\n",
    "\n",
    "*`Qualitative`* features are *not* recorded as numbers. These are typically labels, names, or other non-numerical descriptions. This type of data is also called **categorical**, since these non-numerical labels are often categories of things.\n",

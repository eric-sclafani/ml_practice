I could collect the following data from a large amount of people working at various companies: <span style=\"color:lightblue\">gender</span>, <span style=\"color:lightblue\">age</span>, <span style=\"color:lightblue\">salary</span>, <span style=\"color:lightblue\">years spent at the company</span>, <span style=\"color:lightblue\">education level</span>, and so on. I could then plot this data to `look for trends`. I could also try to `predict` someone's salary based off this data.\n",

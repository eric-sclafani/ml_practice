This repo contains code for my LIN 538 final project, which is an end-to-end machine learning project walkthrough. 

# **Intended audience**

The intended audience is anyone `completely new to machine learning` with little to no math background (it is assumed that you have basic python knowledge, however)

I do include mathematical formulas, but they are never the focus. They are there so you can get used to them. They are also accompanied with hefty explanations and code samples that breakdown what the equations do. 

From my experience, `true understanding` comes from simple explanations and visualizations, as well as personal experimentation. While equations and mathematical theory are very important, they can often deter people new to machine learning.

# **Layout**

Each notebook contains a mixture of notes, visualizations, and code samples for walking you through a machine learning project. Additionally, they contain exercises to test your knowledge. Answers are provided to check your work. 

Alongside my code samples, starting in `02_Data_Selection.ipynb`, you will have the option of writing your own code to use a `dataset of your choice`, or the one I recommend you to use. 

If you'd like, you *can* use the dataset I use for the code samples, but I *`highly`* encourage you to explore things on your own. The point of this is to build up experience through experimentation and to learn the python machine learning tools first hand.

# Data

Below is a list of datasets I either uses, referenced, or planned to use and didn't make the final cut.
